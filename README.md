# Mission_to_Mars
### Overview
Mars enthusiast Robin would like to create a website focused on Mars to attract the attention of NASA. To create this website, news articles, images, and an html table were scraped from four websites using a python script. The data was stored in MongoDB for usage in a flask application implementing bootstrap 3. The website primarily exists as a static display piece, but there is a "scrape new data" button that queries for the newest information, stores it in MongoDB and then updates the information displayed on the website.

Mission to Mars was a project to scrape data about Mars from the websites below using Python and MongoDB and to use Flask, HTML, and CSS to display the latest scraped news articles, facts, and images on one customized website.

The links below were scraped to pull the data for the website:
